# Module 5 Final Project

(technical presentation can be found in index.ipynb file in project_files folder)


## Goal

Attempt to forecast the outcomes of March Madness during this year's NCAA Division I Menâ€™s Basketball Championships.
In this notebook, we construct a classifier to attempt to forecast the outcomes of 2017-2019 NCAAM March Madness first round matchups. Although our goal is overall preditions of the first round, we will keep special attention to predicting the upsets that occur.

#### Define Upsets:
An upset is considered a lower seed beating a higher seed team (i.e. 15 beats 2, 10 beats 5, and even 9 beats 8)

## Data

#### Raw Data Description:

Each season there are thousands of NCAA basketball games played between Division I men's teams, culminating in March Madness, the 68-team national championship that starts in the middle of March. From Google's Kaggle NCAAM March Madness competition, I have gathered various csv datasets containing a large amount of historical data about college basketball games and individual teams from 1985. The main data used in this project includes:

#### Desired Train and Test Dataset Construction:

Our dataset contains

## Hypertuning Parameters and Modeling



## Interpreting Results



## Future Work

- Include individual player significance (injuries, player talent)  
- Include secondary tournament results  
- Include past tournament results  
- Find better parameters for classifiers (test for better model parameters in gridsearch)  
- Arrange target to show upset winning rather than lower Team ID (this should force the coefficents to value upsets in predictions)  
- Make functions more efficient (slow down runtime for computing features)
