# Module 5 Final Project


## Introduction

Attempt to forecast the outcomes of March Madness during this year's NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Championships.

## Stages

In the first stage of the competition, I will rely on results of past tournaments to build and test models.

In the second stage, I will forecast outcomes of all possible matchups in the 2020 NCAA Division I Men’s and Women’s Basketball Championships.

## Data

Data Description:

Each season there are thousands of NCAA basketball games played between Division I men's teams, culminating in March Madness®, the 68-team national championship that starts in the middle of March. We have provided a large amount of historical data about college basketball games and teams, going back many years. Armed with this historical data, you can explore it and develop your own distinctive ways of predicting March Madness® game outcomes. You can even evaluate and compare different approaches by seeing which of them would have done best at predicting tournament games from the past.

## Goal

Using a Random Forest Classifier, we will classify each possible matchup as a win or loss and return the probability the match lands in one of the two choices.
